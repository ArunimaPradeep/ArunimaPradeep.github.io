# InteractiveWebmap
### The purpose of creating an interactive web map plugin for spatial analysis is to provide accessible information to individuals who need to understand their vulnerability to flooding. The goal is to enable them to take the necessary understanding of precautions and prevent significant business crises caused by floods. As these MSMEs are typically individuals with limited education, it is more suitable to offer them an interactive visualization experience instead of expecting them to read extensive research literature. This approach will help them grasp the importance of being prepared for future disasters.
